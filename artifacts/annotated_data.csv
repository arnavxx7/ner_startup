"Harness hits $5.5B valuation with $240M raise to automate AI’s ‘after-code’ gap
AI DevOps tool Harness, founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal, is on track to exceed $250 million in annual recurring revenue in 2025, Bansal tells TechCrunch. 

The startup just raised a fresh $240 million Series E funding round that values the company at $5.5 billion post-money.

The round includes a $200 million primary investment led by Goldman Sachs and a planned $40 million tender offer with participation from IVP, Menlo Ventures, and Unusual Ventures. The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said.

The new valuation is a 49% jump from its $3.7 billion valuation in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date.

As AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness’s tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems.

Bansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well.

Harness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer’s software delivery processes and architecture.

“This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch.

The purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer’s specific policies, architecture, and operational requirements.

Harness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI’s recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely.

As AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use.

Microsoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams, and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts.

The San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness’s biggest development center outside the U.S.

Harness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets.

It should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal merged his software observability firm Traceable with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection.

“We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that’s driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.”

While this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit, Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline.

“That’s what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”","[{'label': ['Startup Name'], 'points': [{'start': 0, 'end': 7, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 95, 'end': 102, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 1154, 'end': 1165, 'text': 'AppDynamics'}, {'start': 1256, 'end': 1263, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 1494, 'end': 1501, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 1791, 'end': 1798, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 2205, 'end': 2212, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 2218, 'end': 2225, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 2714, 'end': 2721, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 2760, 'end': 2767, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 3164, 'end': 3173, 'text': 'Traceable'}, {'start': 3179, 'end': 3186, 'text': 'Harness'}, {'start': 3677, 'end': 3684, 'text': 'Harness'}]}, {'label': ['Founder Name'], 'points': [{'start': 142, 'end': 154, 'text': 'Jyoti Bansal'}, {'start': 228, 'end': 234, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 1090, 'end': 1096, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 1237, 'end': 1243, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 1530, 'end': 1536, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 1961, 'end': 1967, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 2467, 'end': 2473, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 3113, 'end': 3119, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 3371, 'end': 3377, 'text': 'Bansal'}, {'start': 3642, 'end': 3648, 'text': 'Bansal'}]}, {'label': ['Valuation'], 'points': [{'start': 13, 'end': 18, 'text': '$5.5B'}, {'start': 323, 'end': 335, 'text': '$5.5 billion'}, {'start': 647, 'end': 659, 'text': '$3.7 billion'}, {'start': 1179, 'end': 1191, 'text': '$3.7 billion'}]}, {'label': ['Funding Amount'], 'points': [{'start': 34, 'end': 39, 'text': '$240M'}, {'start': 271, 'end': 283, 'text': '$240 million'}, {'start': 369, 'end': 381, 'text': '$200 million'}, {'start': 437, 'end': 448, 'text': '$40 million'}, {'start': 675, 'end': 687, 'text': '$230 million'}, {'start': 747, 'end': 759, 'text': '$570 million'}]}, {'label': ['Revenue'], 'points': [{'start': 186, 'end': 198, 'text': '$250 million'}]}, {'label': ['Investment Company'], 'points': [{'start': 407, 'end': 420, 'text': 'Goldman Sachs'}, {'start': 489, 'end': 492, 'text': 'IVP'}, {'start': 494, 'end': 508, 'text': 'Menlo Ventures'}, {'start': 514, 'end': 530, 'text': 'Unusual Ventures'}]}, {'label': ['Company Buying Startup'], 'points': [{'start': 1169, 'end': 1174, 'text': 'Cisco'}]}]"
"Intel pursued deals that boosted CEO Lip-Bu Tan&#39;s fortune, sources say
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 : When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.

Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.

Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.

Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.

Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.

Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”

The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. 

Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.

VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEO

Intel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.

Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.

Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.

In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.

Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.

Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.

Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”

Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.

Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”

Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.

In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.

U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.

DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGY

Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”

Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.

The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.

SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.

Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.

Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was ""highly CONFLICTED.”

According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.

Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. 

TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITAL

Soon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.

Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.

One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.

ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan ""has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”

Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.

Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.

Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.

Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.

One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.

TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK 

 The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. 

At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova.

Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”

The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.

Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.

The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.

The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. 

INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUP

In 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. 

Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.

SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. 

But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications.

In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. 

The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said.

Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. 

In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. 

In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”

Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said.","[{'label': ['Startup Name'], 'points': [{'start': 136, 'end': 141, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 244, 'end': 249, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 340, 'end': 345, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 447, 'end': 452, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 542, 'end': 547, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 561, 'end': 566, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 671, 'end': 676, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 794, 'end': 799, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 1069, 'end': 1074, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 1319, 'end': 1324, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 2769, 'end': 2774, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 2950, 'end': 2955, 'text': 'Rivos'}, {'start': 3062, 'end': 3071, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 3175, 'end': 3184, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 3267, 'end': 3276, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 3543, 'end': 3552, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 4389, 'end': 4400, 'text': 'proteanTecs'}, {'start': 4596, 'end': 4607, 'text': 'ProteanTecs'}, {'start': 5066, 'end': 5075, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 5971, 'end': 5980, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6128, 'end': 6137, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6238, 'end': 6247, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6386, 'end': 6395, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6496, 'end': 6505, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6689, 'end': 6698, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 6770, 'end': 6779, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 7421, 'end': 7430, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 7545, 'end': 7554, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 7660, 'end': 7669, 'text': 'SambaNova'}, {'start': 7709, 'end': 7718, 'text': 'SambaNova'}]}, {'label': ['Founder Name'], 'points': [{'start': 39, 'end': 49, 'text': 'Lip-Bu Tan'}, {'start': 298, 'end': 308, 'text': 'Lip-Bu Tan'}]}, {'label': ['Investment Company'], 'points': [{'start': 0, 'end': 5, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 149, 'end': 154, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 316, 'end': 321, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 470, 'end': 475, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 599, 'end': 604, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 956, 'end': 971, 'text': 'Walden Catalyst'}, {'start': 1133, 'end': 1138, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 1206, 'end': 1219, 'text': 'Intel Capital'}, {'start': 1425, 'end': 1430, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 1445, 'end': 1451, 'text': 'Nvidia'}, {'start': 1483, 'end': 1491, 'text': 'SoftBank'}, {'start': 1675, 'end': 1680, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 3878, 'end': 3883, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 3968, 'end': 3981, 'text': 'Intel Capital'}, {'start': 4016, 'end': 4029, 'text': 'Intel Capital'}, {'start': 4310, 'end': 4328, 'text': 'A&E Investment LLC'}, {'start': 4330, 'end': 4345, 'text': 'Celesta Capital'}, {'start': 4350, 'end': 4370, 'text': 'Walden International'}, {'start': 4452, 'end': 4465, 'text': 'Intel Capital'}, {'start': 4496, 'end': 4514, 'text': 'A&E Investment LLC'}, {'start': 4516, 'end': 4531, 'text': 'Walden Catalyst'}, {'start': 4536, 'end': 4556, 'text': 'Walden International'}, {'start': 4668, 'end': 4683, 'text': 'Celesta Capital'}, {'start': 4749, 'end': 4762, 'text': 'Intel Capital'}, {'start': 4811, 'end': 4816, 'text': 'Intel'}, {'start': 6100, 'end': 6120, 'text': 'Walden International'}, {'start': 6296, 'end': 6304, 'text': 'SoftBank'}, {'start': 6350, 'end': 6358, 'text': 'SoftBank'}, {'start': 6428, 'end': 6436, 'text': 'SoftBank'}]}, {'label': ['Funding Amount'], 'points': [{'start': 1438, 'end': 1448, 'text': '$5 billion'}, {'start': 1464, 'end': 1474, 'text': '$2 billion'}, {'start': 2153, 'end': 2165, 'text': '$8.9 billion'}, {'start': 6140, 'end': 6151, 'text': '$56 million'}, {'start': 6358, 'end': 6370, 'text': '$676 million'}]}, {'label': ['Valuation'], 'points': [{'start': 651, 'end': 661, 'text': '$2 billion'}, {'start': 755, 'end': 765, 'text': '$4 billion'}, {'start': 6400, 'end': 6410, 'text': '$5 billion'}, {'start': 7096, 'end': 7106, 'text': '$2 billion'}, {'start': 7117, 'end': 7127, 'text': '$3 billion'}]}, {'label': ['Company Buying Startup'], 'points': [{'start': 531, 'end': 535, 'text': 'Meta'}, {'start': 581, 'end': 585, 'text': 'Meta'}, {'start': 617, 'end': 621, 'text': 'Meta'}, {'start': 770, 'end': 774, 'text': 'Meta'}, {'start': 876, 'end': 880, 'text': 'Meta'}]}]"

iStockQuantum computing is still nascent, but its potential spans many industries.

India’s deep tech startup ecosystem is booming. As per NASSCOM, India’s deep tech firms – those based on advanced engineering and scientific breakthroughs – grew from about 1,600 in 2019 to over 3,000 by 2024. The ecosystem has seen a surge of government support and private funding. For example, in 2024, Indian deep-tech startups collectively raised about $1.6 billion – a 78% jump from 2023. Elite research campuses mirror this momentum: the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras alone launched over 100 new deep-tech ventures in the year ending March 2025. Such growth reflects strong fundamentals – abundant engineering talent, a culture of innovation, and supportive policies – positioning India as an emerging global deep-tech hub.Among these emerging fields, quantum computing has drawn particular attention as a potential game-changer. Quantum computers exploit the laws of quantum mechanics to manipulate information in fundamentally new ways. This is a frontier that “promises to speed up computing and solve problems out of reach for today’s machines”.Technology leaders, including Nvidia’s CEO, have highlighted quantum computing as approaching a critical phase of practical applicability. In other words, practical applications of quantum computing could arrive sooner than many expect. Even as AI dominates headlines, analysts warn that quantum is emerging as “another crucial front” in the global tech race for innovation.Quantum in action: Key application areasQuantum computing is still nascent, but its potential spans many industries. Current research and prototypes suggest the following applications:AI and Machine Learning: Quantum techniques could accelerate the training of complex AI models or generate new kinds of data. For instance, quantum algorithms have been shown to generate unique data sets to train AI systems in life sciences. Such hybrid “quantum AI” methods aim to tackle problems that classical computers struggle with, potentially driving advances in image recognition, natural language processing, and beyond.Live EventsDrug Discovery & Materials Science: One of the most touted uses is simulating molecules and materials at the quantum level. Quantum algorithms have shown in early experiments that they can drastically speed up molecular modelling – for example, enabling the measurement of molecular structures to accelerate drug discovery or identify new advanced materials. This could shorten the time to find new medicines or design superconductors, batteries, and other materials by examining quantum interactions that defy classical simulation.Finance and Optimisation: In finance, quantum methods promise to optimise complex systems and risk models. Preliminary studies indicate that quantum processors can speed up tasks like portfolio optimisation, option pricing, and fraud detection. Market analysts forecast rapid growth: the global quantum computing industry is estimated to be between on the order of $5 and $17 billion. Financial modelling and operations research are among the areas expected to see early commercial gains.Cybersecurity – Quantum-Safe Encryption: Quantum computing also reshapes cybersecurity in two ways. First, powerful quantum computers will one day threaten today’s encryption (breaking RSA/ECC). In response, Indian researchers and startups are developing quantum-secure cryptography. For example, quantum key distribution (QKD) uses the physics of qubits to share encryption keys – any eavesdropper causes detectable disturbances, alerting defenders. In simple terms, intercepting a quantum key “collapses” its state and immediately signals an intrusion. India’s defense and telecom sectors are already experimenting with QKD and quantum random-number generators to future-proof communications. These solutions promise next-generation security: unlike classical algorithms, they are rooted in the fundamental laws of physics.Together, these use cases show why quantum computing is attracting cross-sector interest. Whether it’s speeding up AI, discovering a new drug, designing a nanomaterial, optimising a financial portfolio, or securing a network, quantum techniques offer long-term transformative potential.Opportunities and challenges for Indian startupsFor Indian entrepreneurs, quantum computing represents a frontier with huge upside – but also unique hurdles. On the opportunity side, the market potential is enormous. As quoted above, global projections run into the tens of billions, and countries that develop quantum leadership stand to reap strategic and economic benefits. India’s large pool of STEM talent and growing innovation culture provide a foundation to build on. Domestic startups can leverage spillovers from India’s expertise in IT, software, and chip design, applying it to new quantum-based products. Moreover, because quantum technology is still in an early stage globally, Indian companies have a chance to “leapfrog” by focusing on niche strengths or solutions for local industry problems. Finally, India has a compelling cost and diversity advantage: with a vast base of students and researchers in engineering and science, innovation can emerge from across the country — not just major tech hubsHowever, several challenges loom. Quantum computing requires specialised hardware and deep scientific knowledge. Presently, India has only limited capabilities in building qubit devices and quantum chips, relying largely on imported hardware. Analysts emphasize that “India continues to lag in the quantum hardware space”. Overcoming this will require significant investment in R&D and manufacturing.Another challenge is funding and commercialisation timelines. Developing quantum technology is time-consuming and capital-intensive. Startups often need “long-term, patient capital” to reach viability. Many Indian quantum ventures have been primarily financed by angel investors so far, with institutional venture firms playing a smaller role. Experts argue that India will need to attract larger, strategic investments (such as government-backed funds and corporate consortia) to de-risk the field and sustain multi-year R&D. In fact, recent reports urge more investment in quantum hardware and a concerted effort to “create a market for quantum products”, implying that public-private coordination is critical.Despite these obstacles, momentum is strong. However, startups must balance ambition with sustainability, given the long development cycles typical of deep-tech ventures. With government programs and deep-pocketed VCs gradually entering the space, the next few years will be critical to prove concepts and build viable products. “The quantum revolution has begun,” notes one report, and India is working to accelerate from research labs to market-ready solutions.Government, academia, and investor supportRecognising quantum’s strategic importance, Indian institutions have launched several ecosystem-building initiatives:National Quantum Mission (NQM): In 2023, the Union Cabinet approved an eight-year National Quantum Mission with a ₹6,000 crore ($720M) budget. The mission’s goal is to seed and scale quantum R&D and build a domestic industry in India. It aims to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers (50–1000 qubits) and related infrastructure (e.g., quantum communication networks, sensors, and materials). The NQM funds research centers, prototype development, and technology hubs across the country.Thematic Research Hubs: As part of NQM, four thematic hubs have been set up at premier institutions: quantum computing at IISc Bengaluru, quantum communications at IIT Madras, quantum sensing at IIT Bombay, and quantum materials at IIT Delhi. These hubs bring together researchers and startups to collaborate on core technologies. For example, through the NQM and allied programs, Indian institutes are building advanced labs for quantum optics, superconducting qubits, atomic clocks, and more. The mission’s funding also supports developing quantum materials (superconductors, entangled photon sources, etc.) for new devices.Startup Funding Calls: The government has actively engaged with entrepreneurs. The DST’s Quantum Technology Cell regularly issues calls for startup proposals in each quantum domain. Recent announcements include dedicated funding opportunities for quantum computing startups, as well as separate calls for quantum communication, sensing/metrology, and materials/device innovation. Eight promising quantum startups have already been formally supported under the NQM in early rounds. These rolling calls and grants lower the barrier for entrepreneurs by providing capital and mentorship tied to the mission’s goals.Budget and Funds: In the 2025 Union Budget, the government doubled down on deep tech. It allocated Rs20,000 crore (~$2.4B) toward a new fund-of-funds for deep technology R&D, explicitly citing quantum computing, AI, and biotech as target areas. This large pool is intended to catalyse private investment in high-risk, long-term projects. The budget also expanded the existing Startup Fund-of-Funds (additional ₹10,000 crore), part of a broader effort (the ₹1 lakh crore R&D and Innovation scheme) to boost domestic innovation. These financial initiatives signal that India seeks to align public and private capital behind frontier technologies.State and Industry Initiatives: Beyond central programs, some states and companies are making moves. Notably, Andhra Pradesh has launched an “Amaravati Quantum Valley” project. In September 2025, the state announced a ₹40 crore investment to build India’s first Quantum Reference Facility (for testing and benchmarking qubits) and a ₹200 crore plan for a cryogenic components factory – both aimed at laying the foundation for domestic quantum hardware. Similarly, collaborations with industry (e.g., in Amaravati’s plan with IBM and TCS) show growing corporate interest in India’s quantum ambitions.Venture Capital and Alliances: Venture capitalists are increasingly eyeing deep tech. In mid-2025, a new India Deep Tech Investment Alliance (IDTA) was formed by leading U.S. and Indian VC/PE firms to mobilize over $1 billion for India’s deep-tech startups (including quantum). This coalition, aligned with India’s R&D scheme, aims to mobilise long-term investments and global expertise across semiconductors, AI, quantum, and other frontier fields. Its launch illustrates growing confidence: investors are now discussing 5–10 year “patient capital” commitments to these startups.Taken together, these ecosystem efforts – from curricula and labs to grants and funds – create a more fertile environment for quantum innovation. The hope is to create a virtuous cycle: government support attracts entrepreneurs and investment, who then demonstrate viable quantum products and spin off new ventures, which in turn justify more R&D and commercialisation.In a nutshell, India’s deep tech startup ecosystem is entering a quantum-powered phase. Backed by visionary policies and growing capital, the country aims to accelerate quantum research and startups. While challenges in hardware, talent, and market readiness remain, the progress of national missions, university research hubs, and investor initiatives suggests a vibrant path ahead. For those tracking emerging technologies in India, quantum computing is no longer a distant promise – it’s already shaping strategies and collaborations today.The writer is Co-founder & CTO of Sanchiconnect.

"Israeli startup Port raises $100m at $800m valuation
Israeli agentic developer portal Port today announced the completion of a $100 million Series C financing round led by General Atlantic with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners and Team8. The round gives Port a valuation of $800 million and brings total funding raised to date to $158 million.

The investment will allow Port to assist the software industry’s transition from manual to autonomous engineering through its Agentic Engineering Platform (AEP). The company powers hundreds of customers worldwide including GitHub, British Telecom, Visa, Sonar, StubHub, Serko, and Nando's. Port has seen major customer growth and 300% revenue increase in the past year.

Port's AEP allows AI agents to handle operational responsibilities across the entire software lifecycle. Agents process tickets from coding to production, self-heal incidents, remediate vulnerabilities, and maintain compliance standards, unlocking unprecedented velocity while keeping humans in control. The platform connects to the entire tech stack to provide agents with necessary context, implements guardrails to ensure safe and consistent actions, and orchestrates workflows through a unified engine.

Port was founded by CEO Zohar Einy and CTO Yonatan Boguslavski. Before Port, Einy cofounded Aporia, backed by TLV Partners, which also invested in Port in previous rounds.

Einy said, ""The big question in our industry is what engineering looks like in an AI world. Our view is simple: humans and agents will run the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) together. Agents take on the operational load, humans stay in control, and organizations gain a level of velocity we've never had before. That's the future we're building with Port.""

"Taxed, Unregulated & Still Growing: Inside India’s Crypto-Blockchain Contradiction
India entered 2025 facing a complex Web3 paradox. It is the world's largest adopter of blockchain technology for the third consecutive year and home to more than 1,250 Web3 startups that have collectively raised USD 3.5 billion to date (as per Web3 VC firm Hashed Emergent's analysis). Yet the country's most ambitious founders remain constrained by unclear regulations, an unforgiving tax regime and a policy vacuum that has left the industry suspended between promise and frustration. 

India has not just survived the ""crypto winter"" and bear market; it has strengthened its grip, ranking first in blockchain adoption for the third consecutive year and cementing its status as the world’s second-largest developer market.

The ""Comeback Year"" And Tax Wall

""This year has really been a comeback year for India’s crypto ecosystem,"" says Ashish Singhal, Co-founder at CoinSwitch, one of the country's largest exchanges. The resurgence is palpable in the trading pits as well. In 2025, spot volumes in blue-chip crypto tokens rose 114 per cent, accompanied by a 27 per cent increase in new traders.

However, this growth comes with an asterisk. While global volumes have recovered about 80 per cent following positive regulatory signals from the US, India's recovery lags at 50-60 per cent. The culprit remains the 1 per cent TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) and a flat 30 per cent tax on gains, a policy that Singhal says initially wiped out 90 per cent of India's trading volume.

""The TDS structure disincentivised trading,"" Singhal explains. ""Long-term holders were still fine... but overall, India lost about 90 per cent of its trading volume.""

Despite this, the demographics of the market are shifting fundamentally. Young investors (aged 18-35) now comprise nearly 75 per cent of active users and drive half of all trading volumes. Also, women traders are growing nearly twice as fast as men across all city tiers, indicating a rapidly diversifying investor base, Hashed Emergent's data suggests.

The Great Pivot

While traders battle tax headwinds, the builders are busy re-architecting the internet. Sharanya Sahai, Vice President of Investment at Hashed Emergent, pointed out this critical dichotomy during his keynote at the recent India Blockchain Week 2025 event. ""The government adoption has been robust... where they’ve been actively advocating for the underlying tech, but not the cryptocurrency as an asset class.""

This support for ""tech-not-crypto"" is visible in the public sector. Almost seven states and 22 government departments have completed 332 million verifications using blockchain under the national framework. Use cases range from dispute resolution and police complaints to tamper-proof election campaign testing.

Private enterprise is following suit, but with a twist regarding the topic of ""stablecoins."" While the US markets thrive on stablecoins like USDC, Indian innovators are treading carefully around the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) capital controls.

""Stablecoins work well in markets like the US, where capital flows freely. In India, the risk is that they could skirt regulatory boundaries,"" says Singhal.

Meanwhile, Polygon Labs is taking a novel semantic and structural approach to navigate this. While the industry seems to be abuzz with the news of Polygon developing a stablecoin, it's not quite that. Aishwary Gupta, Global Head of Payments and RWA at Polygon Labs, insists, ""It is not a stablecoin... It is a deposit token.""

Unlike a traditional stablecoin, this ""deposit token"" acts as a 1:1 backed representation used strictly for transaction layers, designed to work within the banking system rather than outside it. ""Banks still are the settlement layer,"" Gupta clarifies. ""We are not... giving money from our own pockets.""

The Jio Effect: A Billion Users On-Chain

Perhaps the most important development for India, with regards to blockchain, was entry of Reliance Jio into the space this year. Partnering with the Aptos blockchain, the telecom giant is moving far beyond experimental pilots to what Shankar Jayaraman, SVP at Jio, called ""impact at operation scale,"" during a fireside chat at the India Blockchain Week 2025 in Bengaluru.

""Jio's scale is really kind of unmatched in the industry,"" added Avery Ching, CEO at Aptos, whose blockchain is powering these initiatives.

Jio is looking at three massive, disruptive verticals:

AdTech Disruption: Jio is building a Demand Side Platform (DSP) running completely on-chain. The goal is to deliver ""100 per cent secure and transparent numbers to every ecosystem partner,"" solving the industry-wide plague of opaque metrics. Ching describes this as a potential disruption of the entire ad marketplace: ""We're talking about scale of potentially a billion people seeing ads... that would disrupt entire ad marketplace.""IoT & The Battery Passport: In the energy sector, Jio is utilising blockchain for a ""battery passport"" system. This tracks batteries across the solar and EV ecosystems as they move between partners, ensuring usage is captured accurately and preventing fraud.The Age of AI Agents: Looking toward 2026, Jio is betting on ""autonomous AI agents"" that can handle payments and security for users. Jayaraman said that for an AI agent to be truly autonomous, it needs access to user data (payments, behaviour) without compromising privacy. ""That's where blockchain plays a huge role... ensuring that the data is completely protected,"" he says.

""We need to see Web3 and blockchain in the hands of every consumer,"" Jayaraman asserts. ""It should be outside the realm of trading."" 

Jio is interestingly also working on and testing its 'JioCoin' cryptocurrency on Polygon chain.

The Talent Engine

Fueling these ambitions is a massive, youthful workforce. India now accounts for 15 per cent of the global blockchain developer share, rapidly closing the gap with the US. The demographic skew is stark: 70 per cent of these developers belong to Gen Z and 47 per cent are still students.

""The hustle in India is really strong, honestly,"" observes Aptos' Ching. ""In the US... crypto is still like an area that is... more exciting maybe from an investment and speculation standpoint... I see the opposite in India, where the development is actually the thing that takes off here.""

However, the ecosystem faces a ""mentorship gap."" Sahai notes, ""The biggest challenge facing Indian developers, today's lack of mentorship... we haven't been able to get good quality developers from established enterprises to learn blockchain languages.""

Investing In The Future

Despite the domestic funding caution, global investors remain bullish. Hashed Emergent says that global Web3 investors show ""strong conviction"" in India.

Polygon Labs has evolved its strategy from broad ecosystem grants to targeted, high-conviction bets. ""We have gone very selective,"" says Gupta. Since 2018, Polygon has invested between USD 25-30 million directly from its Labs into the ecosystem. A key recent investment involves a startup founded by ex-NPCI team members, which Polygon backed with ~USD 500,000 to scale India's CBDC infrastructure and make it interoperable with public blockchains.

CoinSwitch is also playing the long game through its venture arm, Web3 Discovery Fund. The USD 10 million fund has already invested in over 25 companies, with check sizes now reaching up to USD 2.5 million. ""We go beyond capital by connecting founders to leading global investors such as a16z, Coinbase and Tiger Global,"" Singhal adds.

2026 And Beyond

The sentiment in India's Web3 industry continues to be one of cautious optimism. The industry is no longer asking for permission to exist; it is asking for regulatory clarity to lead.

""We're not there yet. Clear regulations, hopefully in the next two years, will be the real game changer for India,"" says Singhal.

For the builders, the focus remains on solving real problems rather than chasing crypto action. As Jayaraman put it, referring to Jio's massive pipeline of blockchain applications: ""That is just the tip of the iceberg. There is lot more.""","[{'label': ['Startup Name'], 'points': [{'start': 935, 'end': 945, 'text': 'CoinSwitch'}, {'start': 2696, 'end': 2708, 'text': 'Polygon Labs'}, {'start': 2782, 'end': 2789, 'text': 'Polygon'}, {'start': 2868, 'end': 2880, 'text': 'Polygon Labs'}, {'start': 3232, 'end': 3244, 'text': 'Reliance Jio'}, {'start': 3287, 'end': 3292, 'text': 'Aptos'}, {'start': 3363, 'end': 3366, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 3476, 'end': 3479, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 3539, 'end': 3544, 'text': 'Aptos'}, {'start': 3599, 'end': 3602, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 3660, 'end': 3663, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 4050, 'end': 4053, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 4300, 'end': 4303, 'text': 'Jio'}, {'start': 4775, 'end': 4782, 'text': 'JioCoin'}, {'start': 4808, 'end': 4815, 'text': 'Polygon'}, {'start': 5168, 'end': 5173, 'text': 'Aptos'}, {'start': 5663, 'end': 5675, 'text': 'Polygon Labs'}, {'start': 5795, 'end': 5802, 'text': 'Polygon'}, {'start': 5968, 'end': 5975, 'text': 'Polygon'}, {'start': 6096, 'end': 6106, 'text': 'CoinSwitch'}]}, {'label': ['Investment Company'], 'points': [{'start': 340, 'end': 355, 'text': 'Hashed Emergent'}, {'start': 2000, 'end': 2015, 'text': 'Hashed Emergent'}, {'start': 2175, 'end': 2190, 'text': 'Hashed Emergent'}, {'start': 5540, 'end': 5555, 'text': 'Hashed Emergent'}, {'start': 6153, 'end': 6172, 'text': 'Web3 Discovery Fund'}, {'start': 6361, 'end': 6365, 'text': 'a16z'}, {'start': 6367, 'end': 6375, 'text': 'Coinbase'}, {'start': 6380, 'end': 6392, 'text': 'Tiger Global'}]}, {'label': ['Funding Amount'], 'points': [{'start': 296, 'end': 311, 'text': 'USD 3.5 billion'}, {'start': 5827, 'end': 5844, 'text': 'USD 25-30 million'}, {'start': 5984, 'end': 5996, 'text': '~USD 500,000'}, {'start': 6179, 'end': 6193, 'text': 'USD 10 million'}, {'start': 6280, 'end': 6295, 'text': 'USD 2.5 million'}]}, {'label': ['Founder Name'], 'points': [{'start': 905, 'end': 919, 'text': 'Ashish Singhal'}, {'start': 3514, 'end': 3525, 'text': 'Avery Ching'}]}]"

Australia has become the first country to formally block children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms. This move has split opinion but reshaped the global debate on online safety. What's happening? From midnight, at least 10 major platforms – including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook – are required to prevent under-16s from using their services or face fines of up to A$49.5 million. The law has drawn sharp criticism from tech companies and free-speech advocates, even as parents and child-safety groups have rallied behind it. What this means: The crackdown hits deep in a country where social media use among young people was near-ubiquitous. The change comes as almost 86% of Australians aged 8 to 15 used social media before the ban. Here’s what different sections say:Nearly 86% of Australians aged 8 to 15 were active on social platforms before the ban.Some teenagers fear isolation, saying the rules could cut them off from their peers and communities.Platforms are already grappling with slowing growth, with studies pointing to flat user numbers and declining engagement.Tech firms argue that under-16 users generate limited ad revenue, but are critical to building long-term user pipelines.Meta warns of riskier alternatives, as children may shift to less regulated apps — and platforms like Lemon8 and Yope have already surged in downloads.Also Read: Elon Musk's X says barring under-16s in Australia 'not our choice'

"Here’s the pitch deck used by Yoodli, the Seattle startup now valued at more than $300M
Define the problem. Describe the solution. Note the value proposition. Highlight leadership bios. Call out your customers. Show growth metrics. Set the long-term vision. 

This is the pitch from Seattle startup Yoodli — and it seems to be working well. 

The company, which sells software that helps users practice important conversations, last week announced a $40 million round, just eight months after raising a separate $13.7 million round in May. Its valuation has about tripled since then to around $300 million.

Yoodli shared its latest pitch deck with GeekWire. The 11-slide presentation has the core elements of a solid deck. It’s straight forward and simple — quick problem-framing and a clear mission statement that sets up the rest of the story.

In a startup era where seemingly every pitch mentions AI, Yoodli’s framing of the technology stands out: “Other AI is replacing jobs; Yoodli uses AI to help humans be their best and take control of their career.”

The deck also reflects Yoodli’s shift from consumer to enterprise. Yoodli got its start in 2021 at the AI2 Incubator in Seattle with a consumer-focused offering targeted at practicing public speaking. It has since turned its focus to the enterprise market, working with companies such as SAP, Google, Snowflake, and Korn Ferry to help employees practice their sales pitches and feedback sessions.

Looking ahead, Yoodli said it will use the new funding to expand into what it calls “experiential learning.”

“Experiential learning is the next step of conversation coaching — helping people learn, practice, and apply skills with roleplays at the center of their experience,” co-founder and CEO Varun Puri wrote on LinkedIn. “We’re making learning more fun and actionable for individuals and much more closely tied to ROI for organizations.”

The raise comes amid competition in the AI-powered workforce training market, as employers look for scalable tools to upskill workers in communication, leadership, and customer engagement.

Yoodli has grown revenue around 900% in the past year. Its headcount has tripled to more than 40 people, including several new C-suite additions.

WestBridge Capital led the latest round, which included previous investors Neotribe and Madrona. 

“Yoodli is becoming the natural way organizations help people learn and build the skills that drive revenue, strengthen customer relationships, and influence culture,” Madrona wrote in a blog post.

Check out the full deck below.

"Lovable becomes a unicorn with $200M Series A just 8 months after launch
Fast-growing Swedish AI vibe coding startup Lovable has become Europe’s latest unicorn. Only eight months since its launch, the startup has raised a $200 million Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8 billion valuation.

Like Cursor and other platforms that help developers write code and build apps by harnessing the coding and reasoning abilities of large language models, Stockholm-based Lovable helps people use natural language to create websites and apps. The startup’s trajectory so far has charted straight toward the sky, with the company claiming it now has more than 2.3 million active users.

Those users are using Lovable for free, to be clear, but in a recent talk, the startup’s CEO Anton Osika said it now has more than 180,000 paying subscribers, and the company had reached annual recurring revenues of $75 million in seven months. That traction likely contributed to this oversized Series A.

The Series A saw participation from existing investors, which include 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. In February, Creandum led a $15 million pre-series A round in the company, which at the time said it had reached annual recurring revenue of $17 million and had 30,000 paying customers, with “just $2 million spent.“

The startup has managed this hockey-stick growth with a pretty sparse team of only 45 full-time employees. That’s almost as many as the high-profile angel investors who it said participated in this round, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Remote CEO Job van der Voort, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield, and HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.

Most of Lovable’s traction seems to come from non-technical users, who use it to create prototypes that they can collaborate on later with developers to build more fleshed-out apps and websites. This, and tests, are likely the bulk of the 10 million projects that have been created on the platform to date, the company said in a press release.

But Lovable also envisions itself becoming a tool that can be used to create production-grade applications that underpin full-fledged businesses.
“Every day, brilliant founders and operators with game-changing ideas hit the same wall: they don’t have a developer to realize their vision quickly and easily,” Osika said in a statement.

Notably, Osika recently said on X that he is now an angel investor in a software startup that was ostensibly built with Lovable. (Going by some clues on the post, that startup seems to be ad-testing platform Stardust — we’ve reached out to Startdust’s founder for confirmation, but haven’t heard back.)

Osika also celebrated that an app made by a large Brazilian edtech company using Lovable had grossed $3 million in 48 hours. This could present another growth avenue for Lovable, which has already managed to acquire enterprise customers, including Klarna and HubSpot.","[{'label': ['Startup Name'], 'points': [{'start': 0, 'end': 7, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 117, 'end': 124, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 285, 'end': 291, 'text': 'Cursor'}, {'start': 451, 'end': 458, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 634, 'end': 641, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 1376, 'end': 1382, 'text': 'Klarna'}, {'start': 1412, 'end': 1418, 'text': 'Remote'}, {'start': 1442, 'end': 1447, 'text': 'Slack'}, {'start': 1484, 'end': 1491, 'text': 'HubSpot'}, {'start': 1527, 'end': 1534, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 1764, 'end': 1771, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 2117, 'end': 2124, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 2206, 'end': 2214, 'text': 'Stardust'}, {'start': 2380, 'end': 2387, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 2462, 'end': 2469, 'text': 'Lovable'}, {'start': 2530, 'end': 2536, 'text': 'Klarna'}, {'start': 2541, 'end': 2548, 'text': 'HubSpot'}]}, {'label': ['Funding Amount'], 'points': [{'start': 29, 'end': 34, 'text': '$200M'}, {'start': 220, 'end': 232, 'text': '$200 million'}, {'start': 1060, 'end': 1071, 'text': '$15 million'}]}, {'label': ['Valuation'], 'points': [{'start': 266, 'end': 278, 'text': '$1.8 billion'}]}, {'label': ['Investment Company'], 'points': [{'start': 255, 'end': 260, 'text': 'Accel'}, {'start': 969, 'end': 973, 'text': '20VC'}, {'start': 975, 'end': 985, 'text': 'byFounders'}, {'start': 987, 'end': 995, 'text': 'Creandum'}, {'start': 997, 'end': 1008, 'text': 'Hummingbird'}, {'start': 1014, 'end': 1030, 'text': 'Visionaries Club'}, {'start': 1045, 'end': 1053, 'text': 'Creandum'}]}, {'label': ['Founder Name'], 'points': [{'start': 716, 'end': 727, 'text': 'Anton Osika'}, {'start': 1387, 'end': 1410, 'text': 'Sebastian Siemiatkowski'}, {'start': 1423, 'end': 1440, 'text': 'Job van der Voort'}, {'start': 1459, 'end': 1478, 'text': 'Stewart Butterfield'}, {'start': 1503, 'end': 1516, 'text': 'Dharmesh Shah'}, {'start': 1987, 'end': 1992, 'text': 'Osika'}, {'start': 2023, 'end': 2028, 'text': 'Osika'}, {'start': 2307, 'end': 2312, 'text': 'Osika'}]}, {'label': ['Revenue'], 'points': [{'start': 828, 'end': 839, 'text': '$75 million'}, {'start': 1166, 'end': 1177, 'text': '$17 million'}]}]"
"AI inference startup Runware raises $50M to make AI run faster. Artificial intelligence startup Runware Ltd. wants to make high-performance inference accessible to every company and application developer after raising $50 million in an early-stage funding round.

Announced today, the Series A round is backed by some significant investors, including Dawn Capital, which led it, plus Comcast Ventures, Insight Partners, a16z Speedrun and Speedinvest. It brings Runware’s total amount raised to date to $66 million, underscoring the potential of its high-performance inference platform that specializes in real-time AI image, video and audio generation.

The startup was founded in 2023 by the Romanian developer duo Flaviu Radulescu and Ioana Hreninciuc during the early days of the AI boom. They immediately saw the potential of the first AI image and video generation tools, but they also became frustrated by how slowly they took to generate their outputs, and consequently decided to do something about it.

In a blog post, Radulescu said slow inference is a major impediment to teams trying to ship AI at large scale, as it tends to break the user experience. He also pointed to other problems, including fragmented access to the leading large language models and high costs.

“We built Runware to remove those constraints completely,” he wrote. “Our approach combines custom AI inference hardware with an optimized software stack that reaches up to ten times lower pricing and faster performance than traditional data-center deployments.”

Runware’s inference platform is powered by the Sonic Inference Engine and custom hardware. It can be integrated into any app via the company’s application programming interface, meaning that customers don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure of the LLMs they choose or maintain separate integrations.

The startup has carefully customized its inference infrastructure for open-source models, and provides zero-day access to new releases, meaning customers will always be able to use the latest versions of popular models. The startup sources its infrastructure from cloud providers and says it can reroute the most demanding workloads when more memory is needed to ensure they can be processed rapidly.

“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” Hreninciuc told TechCrunch in an interview.

In essence, Runware can speed up inference for basically any open source model and get them to spit out their outputs in real time, and for that reason it has proved to be immensely popular. The company said it has powered more than 10 billion generations for over 200,000 developers in its first two years, supporting more than 300 million end users globally. Its customers include the AI startup Together Computer Inc., the question-and-answer forum Quora Inc., the image sharing website Freepik Inc. and the website builder Wix.com Inc.

Runware faces a number of competitors in trying to optimize AI inference, some of the most notable being Fal.ai and Replicate Inc. Fal.ai has raised far more money, recently closing on a $140 million round that valued it at $4.5 billion, but it’s much more focused on the scope of its model range rather than on inference speed.

One of the main differences between Runware and its rivals is its pricing. Fal.ai and Replicate both charge customers based on compute time, whereas Runware charges a simple cost-per-image to its customers, meaning they pay only for what they need.

Hreninciuc told TechCrunch the company will use the funds from today’s round to enhance its Sonic Inference Engine and make it even faster, while expanding it to support more than 2 million AI models. In addition, it’s going to look at supporting new modalities besides image, video and audio generation, with its ultimate goal to become “the API for all AI,” she said.","[{'label': ['Startup Name'], 'points': [{'start': 21, 'end': 28, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 97, 'end': 108, 'text': 'Runware Ltd'}, {'start': 452, 'end': 459, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 1253, 'end': 1260, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 1477, 'end': 1484, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 2209, 'end': 2216, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 2577, 'end': 2599, 'text': 'Together Computer Inc.'}, {'start': 2634, 'end': 2644, 'text': 'Quora Inc.'}, {'start': 2678, 'end': 2690, 'text': 'Freepik Inc.'}, {'start': 2717, 'end': 2729, 'text': 'Wix.com Inc.'}, {'start': 2731, 'end': 2738, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 2828, 'end': 2834, 'text': 'Fal.ai'}, {'start': 2839, 'end': 2853, 'text': 'Replicate Inc.'}, {'start': 2854, 'end': 2860, 'text': 'Fal.ai'}, {'start': 3073, 'end': 3080, 'text': 'Runware'}, {'start': 3109, 'end': 3115, 'text': 'Fal.ai'}, {'start': 3120, 'end': 3129, 'text': 'Replicate'}, {'start': 3180, 'end': 3187, 'text': 'Runware'}]}, {'label': ['Funding Amount'], 'points': [{'start': 36, 'end': 40, 'text': '$50M'}, {'start': 213, 'end': 224, 'text': '$50 million'}, {'start': 492, 'end': 503, 'text': '$66 million'}, {'start': 2908, 'end': 2920, 'text': '$140 million'}]}, {'label': ['Founder Name'], 'points': [{'start': 693, 'end': 709, 'text': 'Flaviu Radulescu'}, {'start': 714, 'end': 730, 'text': 'Ioana Hreninciuc'}, {'start': 1045, 'end': 1054, 'text': 'Radulescu'}, {'start': 2154, 'end': 2164, 'text': 'Hreninciuc'}, {'start': 3254, 'end': 3264, 'text': 'Hreninciuc'}]}, {'label': ['Investment Company'], 'points': [{'start': 341, 'end': 353, 'text': 'Dawn Capital'}, {'start': 375, 'end': 391, 'text': 'Comcast Ventures'}, {'start': 393, 'end': 409, 'text': 'Insight Partners'}, {'start': 411, 'end': 424, 'text': 'a16z Speedrun'}, {'start': 429, 'end': 440, 'text': 'Speedinvest'}]}, {'label': ['Valuation'], 'points': [{'start': 2951, 'end': 2963, 'text': '$4.5 billion'}]}]"
"Meta to pay nearly $15 billion for Scale AI stake, The Information reports. June 10 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab has agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Founded in 2016, Scale AI provides vast amounts of labeled data or curated training data, which is crucial for developing sophisticated tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.The deal, which has not been finalized yet, appears to be beneficial for Scale AI's investors including Accel, Index Ventures, Founders Fund and Greenoaks, as well as its current and former employees, the report said.
Meta, Scale AI and the startup's investors did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang will take a top position inside Meta, leading a new ""superintelligence"" lab, according to the report.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been actively recruiting top AI researchers to boost the company's AI efforts, the report said.
The company is fighting the perception that it may have fallen behind in the AI race after its initial set of Llama 4 large language models released in April fell short of performance expectations.
Meta delayed the release of its flagship ""Behemoth"" AI model due to concerns about its capabilities, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.
The company is also facing antitrust concerns related to its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
